								<blockquote>Inara Career Coach inspired me to pursue a long-time passion I had set aside because 
									I had a hard time imagining how to make a career out of a something I loved doing, but that didn't 
									fit into with my daily work duties. Working with my career coach made me realize I already 
									had most of the skills to succeed in my new industry and to identify actionable steps to making
									a career move.</blockquote></p>
